# Using-ANN-to-predict-digits-from-images.

Academic Project

I used the Street View Housing number (SVHN) dataset that contains over 600,000 labeled digits cropped from street level photos. It is one of the most popular image recognition datasets. It has been used in neural networks created by Google to improve map quality by automatically transcribing the address numbers from a patch of pixels. The transcribed number with a known street address helps pinpoint the location of the building it represents. I built an artificial neural network model that can identify the digits in the images with an accuracy rate of ~75% on the SVHN test data set. In the CNN prediction model in my repository, I use the same data set to compare ANN vs CNN models on accuracy and recall.
